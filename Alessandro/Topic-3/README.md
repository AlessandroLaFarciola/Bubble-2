# Java Topic 3 - Logical Operators, while and do while

Exercise 3.1. Try to do the exercise of Java Course: Chapter 4a

Exercise 3.2. Create a while loop that counts from 1 to 20 and print the numbers.

Exercise 3.3. Create a program that read a type of animal. The program should print “this is not the correct animal” until the user write the correct one (“koala”).

Exercise 3.4.  Create a program that read the age and print:

- For other situations print: “you are too old”

Exercise 3.5. Find the mistakes:

a)   int n = 0;

while( n < 10 ) {

System.out.print( n );

}

b)   int b = 0;

while( n < 10 );{

System.out.print( n );

n++;

c)
int c = 0, y = 0, x = 1;

while( n = 0 ){

y = y + x;

x++;

if(x > 5) n = 1;

}

Exercise 3.6. System must request fill numbers until the user write the number zero. After that system will print the sum of all the numbers.
