# Java Topic 6 - Classes and objects

Exercise 6.1.

1. Create a new class Tester.

2. Create a no-argument constructor, and a constructor that initialize all the attributes of the class.

3. The new class should have the following attributes: Name, mindset , isTesterByChance?, long toenails.

4. Create the getter and setters for each attribute.

5. From the main class create two objects with different attributes and perform the following actions:

a. Change the attribute isTesterByChance of Tester 1 and print it

b. Change the attribute mindset of Tester2 and print it

6. From the class Tester, create a method that has a parameter: the object tester and returns the long toenails.  Figure out how to calculate it ÔÅä. Then call the method from the main class and print it.

a. Note: you can call to a class methods from two different ways:

i. Instance a new class: New Tester().calculateLongToenail()

ii. Using the object: Tester1.calculateLongToenail()

Try both options.

Now make up a new method and call it from the main class.
